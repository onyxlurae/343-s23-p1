    <li>My site indeed has 5 pages that serve unique purposes. My home page is titled index.html. All pages are linked to one another in the nav bar.</li>
    <li>All pages use the same fave icon (including this one!)</li>
    <li>All pages share a header that includes a logo and a menu bar</li>
    <li>Navigation links to all pages are found in the header</li>
    <li>Full disclosure, I forgot to include the media queries :&#40;</li>
    <li>I have several images across different pages of my website. All of them have alt attributes that describe them, such as "eclectic eye logo" for the logo image</li>
    <li>I tested all pages on the given sites and made adjustments as recommended, with the exception of "Missing form label" errors on the order page. I couldn't figure out how to fix it</li>
    <li>I use a sans font for h1 headers and serif for the rest of the text</li>
    <li>On my Custom Candle Form page, I created a &#40;currently useless&#41; form that would theoretically would allow users to order a candle</li>
    <li>I have two external links, one in index and the other in contact</li>
    <li>My site is indeed available at <a href="https://onyxlurae.github.io/343-s23-p1">https://onyxlurae.github.io/343-s23-p1</a></li>
